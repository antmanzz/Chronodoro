In summary, it's a short and direct mention of the four main points of this system: the product, the creator, the resources and the project planning and its results.

# Chronodoro, mi reloj de pomodoro

The product is a system that counts down from a number of minutes specified by the user in the free configuration or uses default minutes. The goal is to facilitate the management of effort and productivity with tracking statistics and flexible configuration.

Based on the Pomofocus website, the system offers specific personalization for the project author.

## The product

Designed to be used in the loopback direction of a single host, the system's objective is to provide a simple solution for the requirements.

The requirements are:

* Count down from a selected number of minutes.
* Iterate over iterations separated by short breaks and over cycles by a long break.
* Decide the number of iterations per cycle.
* Decide the number of minutes for short-breaks and for the long-break.
* Access to session statistics.

In these terms, the system is a perfect excuse to practice the implementation of web code based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as graphic design and conceptual design.

## The author 

Antmanzz, that is to say myself who writes this writing, is a junior software developer with a short experience in the development of system software projects. I'm student in Uned, a spanish university whose name is an acronym for National University of Distance Education, in spanish 'Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia'.

I was planning to finish my studies the last year, in 2024, but i could not conclude and defend my final degree project. In this situation I have a lot of time until the next call-up date. So, I thought it was a good idea to keep working on different projects, which allow me improve my skills. Besides, the development of the systema is also motioned by the high frequency with which I use the pomodoro technique during my working time.

## The resources

During the working time, it has been possible to access various bibliographic resources. I would like to highlight the book 'El gran libro de HTML, CSS3 y JavaScript' by J.D Gauchat, third edition, 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke, fourth edition, and the book 'Aprendiendo Git y GitHub' by @midudev, which are titled 'The big book of HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript', 'Eloquent JavaScript' and 'Learning Git and GitHub' in English.

As environment to code the system, I used the Visual Studio Code text editor because it provides me with all tools I need for code languages I was going to use. These are, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, it supports Git; the most popular version control system and support to Markdown, language in which this text is written.

The web browser in which the system in its different versions has been tested is Microsoft Edge, and the HTTP server system on which the system is expected to run is Apache Tomcat, because i'm a frequent user of the Java programming language. Although no compatibilty analysis has been made, it's expected that the system, due to its simplicity, will run on other HTTP servers and web browsers.

Finally, Three audio tracks with license Common Creative 0 have been used. The tracks were downloaded from the Freesound web (https://freesound.org/), the user who uploaded these tracks is called Rudmer_Rotteveel. You can find de readme and license of these tracks in the audio directory of the project.

## The project

The project called 'Chronodoro, mi reloj de pomodoro' is a play on words that merges the term 'Chrono' from the Greek term for 'time' and the suffix 'doro' from the term 'pomodoro' and also from the Greek term for 'gift', the remains is translated to English as 'mi pomodoro watch'. This project was initiated on December 21, 2024 and it was concluded on January 16, 2025. So, the development lasted approximately four weeks, equivalent to one month.

### The plan

Chronodoro was planned to finish its development on two weeks; however, the development lasted two weeks longer. The plan was based on an agile development process, aiming to satisfied requirements one by one without complex analysis or a deep design. The sequence of step was as follows:

1. Build the HTML document following the conceptual map of a pomodoro watch.
2. Build the CSS file associated with the HTML document, declaring styles for each concept in it.
3. Select a color palette to complete the CSS file and create the website icon logo.
4. Build the behaviour web by defining the JavaScript instructions in the JavaScript files.
5. Add tracking statistics.
6. Add configuration options.

Each step was accompanied by brief studies of the participating technologies and quick investigation of the tecniques needed, thanks to today's advances in AI.
